# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript . <br>  Welcome to my *DSA in JavaScript* repo!  This repo is my personal space for learning, practicing, and mastering data structures and algorithms using JavaScript.   It includes step-by-step explanations, code implementations, and problem-solving patterns.

## Learning Roadmap

###  Phase 1: Basics (Current Focus)
- Arrays  
- Strings  
- Functions and Recursion  
- Time & Space Complexity

###  Phase 2: Data Structures
- Linked List  
- Stack & Queue  
- Hash Map / Set  
- Trees and Graphs

### Phase 3: Algorithms
- Searching & Sorting  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Greedy & Graph Algorithms
